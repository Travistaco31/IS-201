                                <li>As a 14 year old my father took time off his work as an owner of civil engineer company (Keller Associates) to help us build a summer residential home painting business. Over the next 4 years through this small business we would produce a $20-30 thousand dollar gross income a summer. The first two years I did mainly manual labor but my final two years included everything from pay roll to marketing, to dealing with customers, to sweating and painting.</li>

                                <li>I set aside 2 years to teaching, serving, and administrating in a global effort. I volunteered in both Peru and in Colorado. At the beginning of mission I was responsible for only one missionary and a group of about 150 local people. By the end of the 2 years my circle of influence had grown to close to 100 missionaries and tens of thousands of local people in a foreign country. This required the overseeing of housing, health, training, planning, goal setting, executing, counseling, and communication between missionaries, locals, and local dignitaries.</li>
